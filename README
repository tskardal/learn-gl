A project for me to play with. Only purpose: improve OpenGL (and C++) skills.

Currently I'm only developing in a linux environment using the g++ compiler. My first goal is to render a cube (whoa!) in a SDL window.

WARNING: expect messy code. This is an pre-early stage :o)

Next steps:

X make it possible to stop the application without having to kill it
- render cube
- improve application design
