A project for me to play with. Its only purpose: improve OpenGL (and C++) skills.

Currently I'm only developing in a linux environment using the g++ compiler.

WARNING: expect messy code. This is an pre-early stage :o)

Coming up: examples/glsl.h

- Use shaders instead of fixed functino pipeline
- Load and render .obj 3d models (simplified)

Completed steps:

X make it possible to stop the application without having to kill it
X render cube
X improve application design (good enough for now..)
