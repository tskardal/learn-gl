A project for me to play with. Its only purpose: improve OpenGL (and C++) skills.

Currently I'm only developing in a linux environment using the g++ compiler.

WARNING: expect messy code. This is an pre-early stage :o)

Coming up:

- add texture support for ObjMesh

Completed steps:

examples/glsl.h

- Begin using shaders instead of fixed function pipeline
- Load and render .obj 3d models (simplified, good enough for now)

examples/cube.h

- make it possible to stop the application without having to kill it
- render cube
- improve application design (good enough for now..)
